Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and 
end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],â€¦] (si < ei), find the minimum number 
of conference rooms required.

Example 1:
Input: meetings = [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: 2
Two meeting rooms needed:
- Meeting room 1: [0, 30]
- Meeting room 2: [5, 10], [15, 20]

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [(2,7)]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Only need one meeting room
