CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW
4.12 Path with sum:
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an 
integer value (which might be positive or negative). 
Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum 
to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at 
the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only 
from parent nodes to child nodes).

https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer 
targetSum, return the number of paths where 
the sum of the values along the path equals 
targetSum.

The path does not need to start or end at the 
root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., 
traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

Example 1:
Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], 
targetSum = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], 
targetSum = 22
Output: 3

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 1000].
-109 <= Node.val <= 10^9
-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000
