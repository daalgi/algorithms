https://leetcode.com/problems/find-winner-on-a-tic-tac-toe-game/

Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid. 
The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:
- Players take turns placing characters into empty 
squares ' '.
- The first player A always places 'X' characters, 
while the second player B always places 'O' characters.
- 'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty 
squares, never on filled ones.
- The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) 
character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
- No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given a 2D integer array moves where moves[i] = [rowi, coli] 
indicates that the ith move will be played on grid[rowi][coli]. 
return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B). In case 
the game ends in a draw return "Draw". If there are still 
movements to play return "Pending".

You can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules 
of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and A will 
play first.

Example 1:
Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: A wins, they always play first.

Example 2:
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: "B"
Explanation: B wins.

Example 3:
Input: moves = [
    [0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
Output: "Draw"
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there 
are no moves to make.

Constraints:
1 <= moves.length <= 9
moves[i].length == 2
0 <= rowi, coli <= 2
There are no repeated elements on moves.
moves follow the rules of tic tac toe.
