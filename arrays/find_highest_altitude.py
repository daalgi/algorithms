https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip 
consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The 
biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where 
gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points 
i and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). 
Return the highest altitude of a point.

Example 1:
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. 
The highest is 1.

Example 2:
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. 
The highest is 0.

Constraints:
n == gain.length
1 <= n <= 100
-100 <= gain[i] <= 100
