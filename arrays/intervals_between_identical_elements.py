https://leetcode.com/problems/intervals-between-identical-elements/

You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers arr.

The interval between two elements in arr is defined 
as the absolute difference between their indices. 
More formally, the interval between arr[i] and 
arr[j] is |i - j|.

Return an array intervals of length n where 
intervals[i] is the sum of intervals between 
arr[i] and each element in arr with the same 
value as arr[i].

Note: |x| is the absolute value of x.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,1,3,1,2,3,3]
Output: [4,2,7,2,4,4,5]
Explanation:
- Index 0: Another 2 is found at index 4. 
|0 - 4| = 4
- Index 1: Another 1 is found at index 3. 
|1 - 3| = 2
- Index 2: Two more 3s are found at indices 5 and 6. 
|2 - 5| + |2 - 6| = 7
- Index 3: Another 1 is found at index 1. 
|3 - 1| = 2
- Index 4: Another 2 is found at index 0. 
|4 - 0| = 4
- Index 5: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 6. 
|5 - 2| + |5 - 6| = 4
- Index 6: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 5. 
|6 - 2| + |6 - 5| = 5

Example 2:
Input: arr = [10,5,10,10]
Output: [5,0,3,4]
Explanation:
- Index 0: Two more 10s are found at indices 2 and 3. 
|0 - 2| + |0 - 3| = 5
- Index 1: There is only one 5 in the array, so its 
sum of intervals to identical elements is 0.
- Index 2: Two more 10s are found at indices 0 and 3. 
|2 - 0| + |2 - 3| = 3
- Index 3: Two more 10s are found at indices 0 and 2. 
|3 - 0| + |3 - 2| = 4

Constraints:
n == arr.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
