https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/

A peak element is an element that is 
strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, 
and return its index. If the array contains 
multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should 
return the index number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index 
number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 
where the peak element is 6.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
