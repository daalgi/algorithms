VARIATION: RESTORE THE SUBSEQUENCE

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest 
strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array 
by deleting some or no elements without changing the order 
of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a 
subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], 
therefore the length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 2500
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
